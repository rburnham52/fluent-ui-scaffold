- [ ] CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions set up
- [x] NuGet package publishing configured (partial, metadata present)
- [x] Proper .gitignore and build configurations
- [x] All projects build successfully
- [ ] Basic CI/CD pipeline runs successfully

- [ ] Set up test execution
- [ ] Configure code coverage reporting
- [ ] Set up NuGet package publishing
- [ ] Configure release workflow

### Task 1.1.1.5: Configure Development Environment
- [x] Create comprehensive `.gitignore`
- [x] Set up editor config
- [x] Configure code analysis rules
- [ ] Set up pre-commit hooks (optional)
- [x] Create development documentation

## Dependencies
- None (foundation story)

## Definition of Done
- [x] All projects build successfully on local machine
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline runs successfully
- [x] Unit test project structure is in place
- [ ] Documentation project is configured
- [x] Code analysis rules are configured
- [x] Package metadata is properly configured

## Notes
- Follow .NET project structure best practices
- Ensure all projects follow consistent naming conventions
