# FluentUIScaffold E2E Testing Framework - Implementation Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap outlines the implementation plan for the FluentUIScaffold E2E Testing Framework, a framework-agnostic UI testing library that provides a fluent API for building maintainable and reusable UI test automation.

## Project Goals

- **Framework Agnostic**: Abstract underlying testing frameworks (Playwright, Selenium) while providing consistent developer experience
- **Fluent API**: Intuitive, chainable API similar to [fluent-test-scaffold](https://github.com/rburnham52/fluent-test-scaffold)
- **Multi-Target Support**: Support .NET 6, 7, 8, 9
- **TDD Approach**: Comprehensive unit tests for all public APIs
- **NuGet Package**: Publishable package with CI/CD integration

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation & Core Architecture (MVP) - 8-10 weeks
- Project setup and infrastructure
- Core interfaces and abstractions
- Fluent API foundation
- Page Object Pattern implementation
- Playwright plugin implementation

### Phase 2: Advanced Features & Verification - 4-6 weeks
- Verification system
- Wait strategies and smart waiting
- Error handling and debugging
- Logging integration

### Phase 3: Documentation & Examples - 2-3 weeks
- API documentation
- Tutorials and best practices
- Sample applications and integration tests
- Performance benchmarks

### Phase 4: Future Enhancements - TBD
- Selenium plugin
- Mobile support
- Visual debugging tools
- Advanced reporting

## Story Tracking

Each story is designed to be:
- **Independent**: Can be worked on in isolation
- **Testable**: Has clear acceptance criteria
- **Trackable**: Can be marked as complete when done
- **Estimable**: Has time estimates for planning

## Story Status Legend

- ðŸ”´ **Not Started**: Story not yet assigned or started
- ðŸŸ¡ **In Progress**: Story currently being worked on
- ðŸŸ¢ **Completed**: Story finished and tested
- ðŸ”µ **Blocked**: Story blocked by dependencies

## Quick Start for Developers

1. Pick a story from the appropriate phase directory
2. Update the story status to "In Progress"
3. Implement the feature following TDD approach
4. Write comprehensive unit tests
5. Update documentation
6. Mark story as "Completed"
