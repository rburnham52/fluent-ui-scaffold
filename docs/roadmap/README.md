# FluentUIScaffold V2.0 - Implementation Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap outlines the implementation plan for FluentUIScaffold V2.0, a framework-agnostic E2E testing library that provides a fluent API for building maintainable and reusable UI test automation. The roadmap is structured around 10 example scenarios that demonstrate increasingly complex testing patterns.

## Project Goals

- **Framework Agnostic**: Abstract underlying testing frameworks (Playwright, Selenium) while providing consistent developer experience
- **Fluent API**: Intuitive, chainable API following V2.0 specification
- **Incremental Development**: Each milestone builds upon the previous, adding features as needed for specific examples
- **TDD Approach**: Comprehensive unit tests for all public APIs
- **NuGet Package**: Publishable package with CI/CD integration

## Implementation Approach

### Example-Driven Development

The roadmap is structured around 10 example scenarios from the V2.0 specification:

1. **User Registration and Login Flow** - Basic navigation and form interactions
2. **Shopping Cart with Dynamic Pricing** - Complex state management and calculations
3. **Multi-Step Form with Validation** - Advanced form handling and validation
4. **Real-Time Data Dashboard** - Async data handling and auto-refresh
5. **File Upload with Progress Tracking** - File handling and progress monitoring
6. **Search with Advanced Filters** - Complex filtering and pagination
7. **Chat Application** - Real-time messaging and history
8. **Calendar Event Scheduling** - Date/time handling and conflict detection
9. **Payment Processing** - Complex form validation and payment flows
10. **Performance Testing** - Network interception and performance monitoring

### Milestone Structure

Each example may span multiple milestones, with each milestone focusing on specific features required for that example:

- **Milestone 1.x**: Core framework features needed for Example 1
- **Milestone 2.x**: Additional features needed for Example 2
- **And so on...**

### Feature Increments

Each milestone adds only the features required for the current example:
- Base element actions (Click, Type, Select, etc.)
- Verification patterns (simple, generic, fluent API)
- Navigation patterns (direct and custom navigation)
- Framework-specific features as needed

## Technology Stack

- **.NET**: 6, 7, 8, 9 (multi-target)
- **Testing Framework**: MSTest (framework-agnostic design)
- **UI Framework**: Playwright (MVP), Selenium (future)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Package**: NuGet
- **Documentation**: Markdown with diagrams

## Success Metrics

- [x] All public APIs have unit tests
- [x] Framework works with any testing framework
- [x] Fluent API matches V2.0 specification exactly
- [x] Documentation is comprehensive and up-to-date
- [ ] NuGet package is published and functional
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline is automated
- [x] Sample applications demonstrate framework usage
- [x] Each milestone has working examples and tests

## Quick Start for Developers

1. Pick a milestone from the appropriate example directory
2. Update the story status to "In Progress"
3. Implement the feature following TDD approach
4. Write comprehensive unit tests
5. Update documentation
6. Mark story as "Completed"

## Current Status

### Completed Work

âœ… **Example 1: User Registration and Login Flow** - COMPLETED
- **Status**: 100% Complete (6/6 stories)
- **Milestones**: All 3 milestones completed
- **Tests**: 43 passing tests with comprehensive coverage
- **Features**: Navigation, form interactions, verification, comprehensive testing

### Current Progress

- **Overall Completion**: 46.2% (6/13 stories completed)
- **Example 1**: 100% Complete
- **Example 2**: Not Started (Shopping Cart with Dynamic Pricing)
- **Example 3**: Not Started (Dashboard with Data Tables)

### Next Steps

The next available story is **Story 2.1.1: Implement Internal Fluent Verification API** from Example 2. This will build upon the foundation established in Example 1 to implement advanced verification patterns needed for shopping cart functionality.
