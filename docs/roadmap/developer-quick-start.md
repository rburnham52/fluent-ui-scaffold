# Developer Quick Start Guide

## Getting Started

This guide will help you understand how to work with the FluentUIScaffold E2E Testing Framework roadmap and stories.

## Story Structure

Each story follows this structure:

### Story Information
- **Epic**: The larger feature area
- **Priority**: Critical, High, Medium, Low
- **Estimated Time**: Time estimate for completion
- **Status**: ðŸ”´ Not Started, ðŸŸ¡ In Progress, ðŸŸ¢ Completed, ðŸ”µ Blocked
- **Assigned To**: Developer assigned to the story
- **Dependencies**: Other stories that must be completed first

### User Story
- **As a** [role]
- **I want** [feature/functionality]
- **So that** [benefit/value]

### Acceptance Criteria
- Clear, testable criteria that define when the story is complete
- Each item can be checked off when completed

### Technical Tasks
- Detailed breakdown of implementation tasks
- Code examples where appropriate
- Specific technical requirements

### Definition of Done
- Final checklist to ensure story is truly complete
- Includes testing, documentation, and quality requirements

## How to Pick Up a Story

### 1. Choose a Story
- Start with Phase 1 stories (foundation)
- Check dependencies are completed
- Look for stories with "Not Started" status
- Consider your skills and interests

### 2. Update Story Status
```markdown
- **Status**: ðŸŸ¡ In Progress
- **Assigned To**: [Your Name]
```

### 3. Understand Requirements
- Read the user story and acceptance criteria
- Review technical tasks and code examples
- Check dependencies and related documentation
- Understand the "Definition of Done"

### 4. Implement Following TDD
- Write unit tests first
- Implement the feature
- Ensure all tests pass
- Follow .NET coding standards

### 5. Update Progress
- Check off completed technical tasks
- Update acceptance criteria as completed
- Mark story as "Completed" when done

## Development Guidelines

### Code Standards
- Follow .NET coding conventions
- Use XML documentation for public APIs
- Implement comprehensive unit tests (>90% coverage)
- Follow SOLID principles
- Use async/await patterns where appropriate

### Testing Requirements
- All public APIs must have unit tests
- Use NUnit as the testing framework
- Follow TDD approach (test first)
- Include integration tests for complex features
- Test both success and failure scenarios

### Documentation
- Update API documentation as you implement
- Add examples to tutorials
- Update diagrams if needed
- Keep README files current

### Git Workflow
- Create feature branch for each story
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Include story number in commit messages
- Create pull request when story is complete
- Update story status when merged

## Example Workflow

### Starting Story 1.1.1: Project Structure Setup

1. **Check Dependencies**: None (foundation story)
2. **Update Status**: Mark as "In Progress"
3. **Create Branch**: `git checkout -b feature/1.1.1-project-structure`
4. **Implement Tasks**:
   - Create solution structure
   - Configure multi-targeting
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline
   - Write unit tests
5. **Update Progress**: Check off completed tasks
6. **Create PR**: When all acceptance criteria met
7. **Mark Complete**: Update status to "Completed"

## Story Dependencies

### Phase 1 Dependencies
```
1.1.1 (Project Structure) â†’ 1.1.2 (Core Interfaces)
1.1.1 + 1.1.2 â†’ 1.2.1 (Fluent Entry Point)
1.1.1 + 1.1.2 + 1.2.1 â†’ 1.2.2 (Element Configuration)
All Phase 1 â†’ 1.3.1 (Playwright Plugin)
```

### Key Dependencies
- **Foundation First**: Always complete foundation stories before dependent stories
- **Parallel Work**: Stories without dependencies can be worked on in parallel
- **Blocked Stories**: Address blocked stories by completing dependencies first

## Communication

### Status Updates
- Update story status regularly
- Communicate blockers immediately
- Share progress in team meetings
- Document any deviations from plan

### Questions and Clarifications
- Ask questions early if requirements are unclear
- Document decisions and rationale
- Share learnings with the team
- Update documentation based on discoveries

## Quality Checklist

Before marking a story as complete:

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] All technical tasks completed
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Code follows standards
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] No breaking changes introduced
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Story status updated
