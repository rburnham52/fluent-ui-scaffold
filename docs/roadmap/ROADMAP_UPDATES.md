# Roadmap Updates - V2.0 Implementation

## Overview

The roadmap has been completely restructured to align with the V2.0 specification and focus on incremental development based on the 10 example scenarios.

## Major Changes

### 1. Structure Reorganization

**Old Structure:**
- Phase-based approach (Phase 1, 2, 3, 4)
- Generic epics and stories
- No clear connection to specific examples

**New Structure:**
- Example-driven approach (Example 1, 2, 3, etc.)
- Milestone-based development within each example
- Clear connection to V2.0 specification examples

### 2. Example-Driven Development

The new roadmap is structured around the 10 example scenarios from the V2.0 specification:

1. **User Registration and Login Flow** - Basic navigation and form interactions
2. **Shopping Cart with Dynamic Pricing** - Complex state management and calculations
3. **Multi-Step Form with Validation** - Advanced form handling and validation
4. **Real-Time Data Dashboard** - Async data handling and auto-refresh
5. **File Upload with Progress Tracking** - File handling and progress monitoring
6. **Search with Advanced Filters** - Complex filtering and pagination
7. **Chat Application** - Real-time messaging and history
8. **Calendar Event Scheduling** - Date/time handling and conflict detection
9. **Payment Processing** - Complex form validation and payment flows
10. **Performance Testing** - Network interception and performance monitoring

### 3. Milestone Structure

Each example spans multiple milestones, with each milestone focusing on specific features:

- **Milestone 1.x**: Core framework features needed for Example 1
- **Milestone 2.x**: Additional features needed for Example 2
- **And so on...**

### 4. Feature Increments

Each milestone adds only the features required for the current example:
- Base element actions (Click, Type, Select, etc.)
- Verification patterns (simple, generic, fluent API)
- Navigation patterns (direct and custom navigation)
- Framework-specific features as needed

## Example 1: User Registration and Login Flow

### Milestone 1.1: Basic Navigation and Framework Setup
- **Story 1.1.1**: Refactor to V2.0 BasePageComponent Pattern
- **Story 1.1.2**: Implement Basic Navigation Methods

### Milestone 1.2: Form Interactions
- **Story 1.2.1**: Implement Base Element Actions
- **Story 1.2.2**: Create Registration and Login Pages

### Milestone 1.3: Basic Verification
- **Story 1.3.1**: Implement Generic Verification
- **Story 1.3.2**: Complete Example 1 Implementation

## Implementation Approach

### 1. Incremental Development

Each milestone builds upon the previous, adding features as needed:
- Start with basic navigation and framework setup
- Add form interactions and element actions
- Implement verification and validation
- Complete the example with comprehensive tests

### 2. Framework-Agnostic Design

All implementations follow the V2.0 specification:
- Framework-agnostic core framework
- Pluggable framework implementations
- Consistent fluent API across frameworks
- Dependency injection first approach

### 3. Test-Driven Development

Each story includes:
- Comprehensive unit tests
- Integration tests
- Working examples
- Documentation updates

## Benefits of New Structure

### 1. Clear Focus

- Each milestone has a specific goal
- Features are added only when needed
- Clear connection to real-world scenarios

### 2. Incremental Learning

- Developers can learn the framework progressively
- Each example builds on previous knowledge
- Complex features are introduced gradually

### 3. Better Testing

- Each example provides comprehensive test scenarios
- Real-world validation of framework capabilities
- Clear acceptance criteria for each story

### 4. Improved Documentation

- Examples serve as documentation
- Clear progression from simple to complex
- Practical demonstrations of framework usage

## Migration from Old Structure

### Completed Stories (Removed)
- Story 1.1.1: Project Structure Setup ✅
- Story 1.1.2: Core Interfaces & Abstractions ✅
- Story 1.2.1: Fluent Entry Point ✅
- Story 1.2.2: Element Configuration System ✅
- Story 1.3.1: Playwright Plugin Implementation ✅

### New Stories (Added)
- Story 1.1.1: Refactor to V2.0 BasePageComponent Pattern
- Story 1.1.2: Implement Basic Navigation Methods
- Story 1.2.1: Implement Base Element Actions
- Story 1.2.2: Create Registration and Login Pages
- Story 1.3.1: Implement Generic Verification
- Story 1.3.2: Complete Example 1 Implementation

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Start with Story 1.1.1**: Refactor to V2.0 BasePageComponent Pattern
2. **Follow dependency chain**: Complete stories in order
3. **Update documentation**: Keep documentation in sync with implementation
4. **Test thoroughly**: Ensure all tests pass at each milestone

### Future Examples
- Example 2: Shopping Cart with Dynamic Pricing
- Example 3: Multi-Step Form with Validation
- Examples 4-10: Advanced scenarios

## Success Metrics

- [ ] All public APIs have unit tests
- [ ] Framework works with any testing framework
- [ ] Fluent API matches V2.0 specification exactly
- [ ] Documentation is comprehensive and up-to-date
- [ ] NuGet package is published and functional
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline is automated
- [ ] Sample applications demonstrate framework usage
- [ ] Each milestone has working examples and tests

## Notes

- The new structure provides a clear path for implementation
- Each example demonstrates specific framework capabilities
- The incremental approach reduces risk and complexity
- The V2.0 specification provides the foundation for all development
